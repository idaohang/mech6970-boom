The binary file

   sanfranciscos.dem.gz

is a GNU-zipped file of the ASCII file sanfranciscos.dem. The ASCII file

   sanfranciscos.dem

contains a United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Digital
Elevation Model (DEM) for the SAN FRANCISCO SOUTH, CA BIG BASIN DEM
quandrangle.  This data set covers an area of roughly 2,800-by-2,200
meters in the San Francisco Bay area of California, USA, with elevations
posted every 30 meters.  The data are referenced to Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM), Zone 10, in the North American Datum of 1927.  Horizonal
units are meters and vertical units are feet.

Product Description
-------------------
The USGS describes the DEM product as the following 
(obtained from the URL description at
http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/products/elevation/dem.html):

"Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) consist of a raster grid of regularly
spaced elevation values that have been primarily derived from the USGS
topographic map series. 

DEMs are available in Native format, written as ANSI-standard ASCII
characters in fixed-block format. 

The USGS produces five types of elevation data:

1. 7.5-Minute DEMs correspond to the USGS 1:24,000- and 1:25,000-scale
topographic quadrangle maps, and are available for all of the U.S. and
its territories. They are cast to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) 
projection system and are referenced to either the North American Datum
(NAD) of 1927 (NAD27) or the NAD of 1983 (NAD83). Most files will have a
grid spacing of 30 meters, but 10-meter grids are also available for some
locations. The average file size of a 30-meter DEM is 1.1 megabytes and
9.9 megabytes for a 10-meter DEM. They are available in Native and Spatial 
Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) format. Native format is distributed on CD-ROM, 
DVD, and File Transfer Protocol (FTP). SDTS is distributed via FTP download."
