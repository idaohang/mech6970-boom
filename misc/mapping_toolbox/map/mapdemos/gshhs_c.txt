The binary file

   gshhs_c.b.gz

is a GNU zipped file of the binary file gshhs_c.b. The binary file

   gshhs_c.b

contains the lowest resolution set of shorelines from Version 1.3 of the
Global Self-Consistent Hierarchical High-Resolution Shoreline (GSHHS)
data set.  The GSHHS data file is provided in the Mapping Toolbox courtesy
of Dr. Paul Wessel of the University of Hawaii and Dr. Walter H. F. Smith
of NOAA.  Wessel and Smith amalgamated the GSHHS from public domain data
bases, including the World Vector Shoreline from the U.S. Defense Mapping
Agency (DMA) -- now the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).  
With extensive processing they removed inconsistencies, such as erratic
points and crossing segments, and assembled the data into closed polygons.  
GSHHS comprises a full-resolution set of shorelines and four reduced-
resolution sets:  high, intermediate, low, and crude.  The last, lowest-
resolution, shoreline set is provided here.  It is the result of applying
the Douglas-Peuker algorithm to the full-resolution data with a
tolerance of 25 kilometers.

The shoreline vectors are in latitude-longitude.  The horizontal datum
is the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 84).

The full GSHHS data set is available from the National Geophysical Data
Center (NGDC), Boulder, Colorado, USA.  For more information on GSHHS
